## ABOUT DATADAO'S

### What is a Dao?
A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization that operates based on smart contracts and blockchain technology. It is designed to be autonomous, decentralized, and governed by its participants rather than a central authority. A DAO's rules and decision-making processes are typically encoded in smart contracts, which are executed automatically and transparently on the blockchain. This allows for greater transparency, trust, and participation among DAO members.

### What is a dataDAO?
A DataDAO, or Data Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a specific type of DAO that focuses on managing and governing data in a decentralized manner. It leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and auditable data storage, sharing, and access mechanisms. DataDAOs aim to address the challenges associated with centralized data platforms by enabling individuals to have ownership and control over their own data, while still allowing for collaboration and data sharing within the network.

### How is it beneficial over a traditional social platform?
- Data Ownership and Control
- Transparrency and Trust 
- Data Security 
- Incentivization and Rewards
- Community Governance

Overall, DataDAOs aim to empower individuals, protect their data rights, and create more equitable and transparent data ecosystems compared to traditional social platforms.

## Intro


## Setup
![Day1](images/Day1.png)
I chose Vue for my frontend due to the ease of use and simple setup for smaller applications.
I wanted to get an MVP up as quickly as possible as I only entered the hackathon just a few days before it was set to end on May 23rd. So basically I entered into a 3-4 Day Sprint.

### Project Ideation
I wanted to build something that the Hackathon organizers Filecoin actually requested and DataDAO's were high on that list. Having prior experience being a part of DAO's, it seemed interesting building something based on this new concept or at least it was new to me. The difference lies in that one focuses on the organization itself while the latter focuses on Data more importantly.
